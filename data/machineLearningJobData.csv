        GitHub Gcopilot is amazing for code. We are bringing this to lawyers. So in essence we're training large language models like GPT-neox to do autocompletion in Word. There is a ton of data available for training, and we have enough funding for a large number of A100 GPUs.This work began as a research project at ETH in Zürich. We have advisors from AI research, law and legal tech.Why Lawyers?Lawyers write a lot of text. Much of that is copy-pasting or piecing together arguments from past cases. They spend a lot of time researching and reformulating details, that somebody else has already figured out.Github copilot was a huge breakthrough for programmers, we want to achieve the same for lawyers.TasksTraining and evaluation of large language modelsTransferring methods from AI research, Improve training and inference efficiencyData engineering. We'll start with 20B open-source GPT neox, but will go back and forth between much smaller models for validation. You'll be part of the 4 person team building pipelines for training and inference.

Autocomplete features will come to GUIs. E.g. a chrome extension that highlights where you should click next, and prefills input fields. Near human-level AI is on the way. We want to position ourselves to have lots of users and data before that happens.

About Deep Science VenturesDeep Science Ventures (DSV) is a venture creator combining available scientific knowledge and founder-type scientists into high-impact ventures to build a future where both humans and the planet thrive. DSV operates in 4 sectors: Agriculture, Climate, Pharmaceuticals and Computation, tackling the challenges defining those areas by taking a first-principles approach and partnering with leading institutions.About The RoleIn 2023, DSV is launching Deep Science Ventures College to exponentially increase the number of people solving the world’s hardest problems through our first accredited training program, the Venture Science Doctorate. We will be building on DSV's proven process of identifying and addressing reasons for failures in key science-driven areas from climate change mitigation and cancer to heterogeneous compute. To date, this has been a long and manual process which limits how rapidly we can address these challenges and how fast any science-driven company can move. With the recent advancements in transformers, semantic search and learning analytics, we see a path to massively accelerate and scale this work to give not only our team but all researchers superhuman powers and, in time, to reduce the cost of science to near zero. We have demonstrated the key principles in-house and are looking to build a team to optimise and productise this work and help us scale to take on hundreds of thousands of challenges.Key ResponsibilitiesDesign, train and deploy custom transformer-based large language models to accelerate the speed of scientific discovery based on our existing tried and tested venture design approaches.Design and evaluate model performance and accuracy metrics relevant to speed and quality of scientific discovery and product development.Lead data strategy integration across internal sources (including text, video and audio data) and external sources and products.Building systems to continually fine-tune leveraging human experience to continually improve the effectivness of the model.Auto-generate into external communication materialRequirementsMachine learning practitioner who thrives on the question of how to make users superhuman by continually optimising models.Has worked in fast moving start-up environments from early 10s of users to hundreds of thousands of users.Up to speed with state-of-the-art in transformers and particularly Large Language Models with strong opinions and ideally practical experience in embedding, LLM-based reasoning/classification, vector databases, semantic search, retrieval strategies and making LLM interfaces fast enough for scale.Experience with fine-tuning and model optimisations (for performance and inference speed/cost).Comfortable leveraging managed services for fast prototyping.Ability to learn – you learn new concepts and skills rapidly and look to understand things in an in-depth wayConfident in designing analytics pipelines to track and optimise user performance and the impact of changes to the modelGood to haveExperience with deploying human-in-the-loop RL or other ‘instruction-tuned’ approaches.Experienced in MLOps for later scalingBenefitsCompetitive salary;Flexible working environment (remote or hybrid);Rapid personal development and massive learning curve;Working with some of the most ambitious and impact-driven individuals you'll ever find;Help build the next generation of hard tech ventures.Apply for this job

Who We Are And What We DoMappedin is the leading platform for indoor spatial data management, digitizing venues, and building best-in-class indoor mapping experiences. Built for scale, our platform enables us to work with leading operators and developers around the world. Mappedin operates in over 1,300 venues across 40+ countries and our Map Editor powers accurate wayfinding experiences across more than 800 million square feet of indoor space.In 2022, Mappedin launched a new product for first responders which is now being piloted in multiple cities, along with expanding its platform product across new venues such as The Australian Grand Prix. Recently named one of Canada’s Top Growing Companies for 2022 in the Globe and Mail Report on Business ranking, Mappedin earned its spot with three-year growth of 158%. With over 70 employees and more hiring to come, Mappedin is well-positioned for growth.Mappedin’s Product and Platform team is a group of developers responsible for Mappedin’s core products used by tens of millions of people: Our Pre-Built Mapping Applications, Developer Tools, and Indoor Mapping Software.Media:Who You Are And What You'll DoYou want to work with a team of developers that use machine learning to solve hard problems in real world, production environments. You understand ML techniques, but know that a cool model is nothing until you get it integrated into a great app used by actual users, with plans and tools to keep it up to date.You’ll be joining the Super Auto team at Mappedin, which is a feature team comprised of Machine Learning, Front End, and Full Stack developers. They can take a new ML-powered tool from inception all the way to production, and keep it fresh once it’s deployed. As a Machine Learning Developer you will help bridge the gap between pure machine learning and feature deployment.You are highly interested in learning about or already have experience in:Machine learning (especially GANNs, object detection, semantic segmentation)Computer VisionDeep learning libraries and frameworks like Tensorflow/keras/PytorchML Ops PythonTypeScriptTest Driven DevelopmentWe understand that not everyone will be familiar with the tech stack or will check all of the boxes above. We would still love for you to apply and we will provide support if required!What are some challenges?You’ll need to know a bit about a bunch of different things. We don’t expect you to be an expert in coming up with the right ML technique to use for a given problem, but we do expect you to be able to pick up how to best help train, use, deploy, and maintain it. Most of Mappedin’s codebase is written in TypeScript, but the ML is done in Python, so you will end up using both languages, and the more you can push to TypeScript the more the rest of the Dev team can contribute.Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.Behind the scenesWe run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We are a REMOTE company. If you’re local, there will probably be a few days a week when you can expect other people to be in the office, but this role could also be fully remote. We work flexible hours, have a flexible vacation policy and work to provide the hardware or office equipment you require to unleash your potential. We will do what it takes to get things done if we said we would do it. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.Mappedin welcomes applications from people with disabilities. We provide reasonable accommodations for candidates upon request through the recruitment process. For additional information, please email us at accessibility@mappedin.com or call us at (519) 594-0102 and ask to speak to a member of the Human Resources team.Powered by JazzHRBj0DVYPhfu

About PerfectRecPerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.Founder Led, Founder FundedOur CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.Working At PerfectRecWe are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.What You'll BringStrong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress. Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1. Willingness to teach and learn. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this. Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways. Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest. What You'll DoCreate and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts. Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains. Identify ways to evaluate and compare competing models. Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories. Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library. Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team. Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate. Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time. Relevant ExperienceWe believe that everybody has the ability to learn and grow. So, relevant doesn't mean required or that you need everything on the list (this isn't a Pokédex). If you've used other tools, languages, and frameworks that are similar to what is listed, please apply! We only list specific tools so that you know the tech stack you're walking into.Python or R. Exploratory data analysis and data visualization. Classical machine learning techniques like classification, regression, regularization, and cross-validation. sklearn, Keras (or other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch). Recommender systems, including learning-to-rank. SQL. Technical writing. Salary & BenefitsWe believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful.Pay Range and Level of Role$130,000 - $300,000 salary and stock options which vest over 4 years. We are hiring data scientists with different levels of experience. Compensation is based on background and experience.Benefits100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living. We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan. We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable. 401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching. Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy. Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable. Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines. (Unfortunately, we probably won't be able to do this for cars.)

About UsFood waste is a $1 trillion problem – costing the world over 1% of global GDP. We’re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 35 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Chicago, Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.We are passionate about living our values and place them at the centre of everything we do.THE ROLEAbout The TeamThe Data team plays a critical role in the continuous improvement of our flagship product - Winnow Vision. We've collected millions of images of food items already, and keep collecting thousands every day from the kitchens we operate in. Those images need to be processed, curated and structured to optimise the quality and accuracy of our AI models. Managing this big data pipeline is no easy task: we operate across the world, in a wide variety of industries and our model needs to recognize food ranging from the Malay Nasi Goreng to the American fried chicken, and everything else in between.We have come a long way - from long data collection time and training small AI models for very specific clients, we have now managed to generalise our approach and can now deploy AI models to almost any kitchen in the world in a matter of a couple of weeks. However, there are still many challenges ahead - today we present a top selection of items to our clients and they confirm the right one - our ambition is to become completely touch less. How can we make our models more confident and more accurate, that is the question!The Data & Analytics team consists of 9 people (6 in Cluj and 3 in London) and is expected to continue to grow in the coming months. Roles range from data operation executives to data scientists.We are investing in developing new products and services, and this role is responsible for leading data analysis for these innovations.About the role:As a Data Scientist Lead, you will be reporting to the Director of Data and Analytics and will have a wide range of responsibilities which includes:Lead and mentor a team of 2 Data ScientistsUse your data skills to enhance the confidence and accuracy for our AI modelsDeveloping and refining complex queries and reports to help other team members execute their rolesPerforming ongoing data analysis to present back insights to clientsShape our data processes to optimize efficiency while reducing costsImagine and deliver insightful analysis aiming at improving our user experienceMonitor and manage the existing fleet of models in the field, and ensure new clients benefit from AI no less than 1 month after installationProduce and track key performance indicatorsTake on more complex data analysis problemsRequirementsExcellent numerical and analytical skillsSolid knowledge in SQL, Python (pandas library particularly) required and willingness to learn moreExperience with data formatting and cleaning, both for numeric and qualitative dataExperience handling large data sets from 1,000s to 100,000s of rowsHighly competent in using Excel (and willing to learn more) Comfortable using macros and formulas such as vlookups, sumifs, and pivot tablesExperience with Mode Analytics a plusEffective Verbal And Written Communication SkillsAbility to adapt communication style to suit different audiences Ability to facilitate group discussionsAttention to detail.

About UsFood waste is a $1 trillion problem – costing the world over 1% of global GDP. We’re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 35 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Chicago, Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.We are passionate about living our values and place them at the centre of everything we do.THE ROLEAbout The TeamThe Data team plays a critical role in the continuous improvement of our flagship product - Winnow Vision. We've collected millions of images of food items already, and keep collecting thousands every day from the kitchens we operate in. Those images need to be processed, curated and structured to optimise the quality and accuracy of our AI models. Managing this big data pipeline is no easy task: we operate across the world, in a wide variety of industries and our model needs to recognize food ranging from the Malay Nasi Goreng to the American fried chicken, and everything else in between.We have come a long way - from long data collection time and training small AI models for very specific clients, we have now managed to generalise our approach and can now deploy AI models to almost any kitchen in the world in a matter of a couple of weeks. However, there are still many challenges ahead - today we present a top selection of items to our clients and they confirm the right one - our ambition is to become completely touch less. How can we make our models more confident and more accurate, that is the question!The Data & Analytics team consists of 9 people (6 in Cluj and 3 in London) and is expected to continue to grow in the coming months. Roles range from data operation executives to data scientists.We are investing in developing new products and services, and this role is responsible for leading data analysis for these innovations.About the role:As a Data Scientist Lead, you will be reporting to the Director of Data and Analytics and will have a wide range of responsibilities which includes:Lead and mentor a team of 2 Data ScientistsUse your data skills to enhance the confidence and accuracy for our AI modelsDeveloping and refining complex queries and reports to help other team members execute their rolesPerforming ongoing data analysis to present back insights to clientsShape our data processes to optimize efficiency while reducing costsImagine and deliver insightful analysis aiming at improving our user experienceMonitor and manage the existing fleet of models in the field, and ensure new clients benefit from AI no less than 1 month after installationProduce and track key performance indicatorsTake on more complex data analysis problemsRequirementsExcellent numerical and analytical skillsSolid knowledge in SQL, Python (pandas library particularly) required and willingness to learn moreExperience with data formatting and cleaning, both for numeric and qualitative dataExperience handling large data sets from 1,000s to 100,000s of rowsHighly competent in using Excel (and willing to learn more) Comfortable using macros and formulas such as vlookups, sumifs, and pivot tablesExperience with Mode Analytics a plusEffective Verbal And Written Communication SkillsAbility to adapt communication style to suit different audiences Ability to facilitate group discussionsAttention to detail.

Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place.

Your Role Rainforest Builder’s Chief Scientist will build the intellectual property that will define how one million hectares of degraded land will be restored to tropical forest. This is one of the most senior positions in the company - you will report directly into the CEO and lead the thinking for this entire area of the business.You will need to define the restoration approach deployed by Rainforest Builder, covering indigenous species selection, silvicultural regime and land sourcing. Your work will directly determine how the company spends very large budgets and you will need to balance a delicate triangle of trade-offs between carbon sequestration, biodiversity uplift and cost.What We’re Looking ForWe’re looking for someone who has an equal love of getting their hands dirty in fieldwork as publishing in top journals. You will spend around one third of your time in the field (in West Africa) and the prospect of travelling to some of the world’s more remote places should be exciting to you. You should enjoy working as part of a multicultural team and have the people skills needed to bridge cultural gaps and get high quality results.This is not a job you will be able to do by yourself. You will need to build a range of partnerships with academic institutions, companies and consultants to give you leverage and ensure that you cover a wide breadth of space with the limited hours you have in one day, week or year.You will be joining a fast-paced entrepreneurial environment and will be the bridge between the business and the academic world. You will need to have exceptionally high scientific standards but be equally pragmatic and capable of deciding what is good enough. You will need to make decisions that will determine how we spend $Ms before having ‘all the data’.Despite your impressive academic achievements to date you should be humble and open to learning. You should enjoy receiving and giving constructive feedback and like being challenged by others. You should be able to find insight in everything from a call with a Cambridge professor to a meeting with local community elders.Your Responsibilities Develop the core intellectual property of Rainforest Builder by devising a proprietary restoration methodology to deliver reliable and cost-effective carbon and biodiversity returns across all our projects. Key metrics measured over time will be $/hectare restored, $/t CO2 sequestered, tCO2/ha/year restored, and biodiversity KPIs to be determined. Key research areas are expected to be i) site selection, ii) indigenous species mix (number and type of species, use of keystone species) and iii) silvicultural regime (land preparation, use of fertiliser and other inputs, planting density, weeding routine). Specific responsibilities include:Developing a series of restoration approaches to optimise carbon, biodiversity and cost based on, amongst other things, a combination of literature, local research and advice from our forestry partners Establishing rigorous trials that produce clear results to help you to adjust your restoration approach confidently in future to optimise cost, carbon and biodiversity furtherStaying on top of the literature and ongoing research in this space and build connections with other restoration teams across the world Build science-based tools to accurately forecast carbon sequestration rates over time for our projects and potential sitesDeveloping species-specific growth and carbon sequestration models based on, amongst other things, large and rapidly-growing proprietary datasets Iterating forecasting tools to improve reliability over time Monitor carbon sequestration and biodiversity uplift across land restored using the most effective approaches and technologiesStaying updated with different monitoring approaches for carbon and biodiversity Piloting new and emerging technologies to measure carbon and biodiversity Rolling them out across the company once they are reliable, cost effective and mature Dotted-line management and supervision of R&D managers in each country of operation (will all be qualified forest scientists from the forestry sector) Build and manage partnerships with academic institutions (in countries of operation and elsewhere) and with other relevant research institutions to collaborate on specific pieces of research and raise the profile of Rainforest Builder Establish your position as a global thought leader in tropical forest restoration RequirementsRequirements and Qualifications Minimum PhD or post-doc level in tropical forest restoration or related fieldAt least 5 years of experience carrying out fieldwork in developing countriesHands-on experience of restoring tropical forests (in Africa preferred but not required)Data modelling skillsA plus:Familiarity with remote sensing data sources for forest observationFamiliarity with GIS mappingExperience measuring carbon and/or biodiversity in tropical forestsExperience out of academia in a more hands-on role, such as an organisation implementing restorationBenefitsCompetitive salary and benefits package in-line with the seniority of the role Stock options 30 days holidayIn person working preferred (4 days a week, London office) but this is flexible

        Reinvent speech recognition technologies to empower us collectively.AI is an incredible thing, especially when we put it to the service of humanity — and not the other way around. We love hearing incredible applications of computer vision, from detecting cancer by looking at your eye or saving your life by making driving autonomous & more secure. But speech recognition applications? They've stayed pretty much at the gadget level, inundating us with talking alarms and smart home assistants.Ava is the exception to the rule - the ampersand-shaped peg in a rather boringly square world. We reinvent speech recognition and speaker identification technologies so we can help 450M deaf & hard-of-hearing people live a fully accessible life. With Ava, they can understand what everyone else is saying in any group conversation, anytime.A difficult challenge to solve? Yes, and that's what we love. What really keeps us up at night though, is the thrill to be impacting day to day people in a meaningful way. And see the smile on our users' faces when they use our product.Don't waste more of your precious gray matter in politics-laden research teams in big companies, and come instead shine your light where the world can see the impact of what you do!What will you do as a Machine Learning Scientist at Ava?You'll own one of the Ava's AI team research objectives to develop solutions for real-world applications of our core technologyYou'll keep an eye out on the state-of-the-art research, through publications or networking with peers, and think of new contributions to improve the state of our stackYou'll help improve the performance and reliability of our cutting-edge AI systems — such as improving the speed and responsiveness of our deep neural networksYou'll work with the rest of the AI team to build and maintain robust internal machine-learning tools and processes, with a focus on our Machine Learning models. Think of projects such as detecting new voices in a 0-shot learning setting, separating overlapped speech or cleaning speech from strong background noisesYou'd be perfect for this role if:You ambition to be a pioneer in the field, and do what is necessary to make things work in real world situationsYou have a PhD degree in machine learning, signal processing or related areaYou have 3+ years of research experience in machine learning (esp. deep learning)You have experience in speech or audio processingYou're of the persistent, yet open-minded and collaborative type: you can own and pursue a research agenda and autonomously carry it out, but appreciate working You care about the strategic and business implications of anything you build. You're not just going after cool stuff — you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom lineBonus: You have experience in speaker diarization, speaker identification, speech recognition, acoustic modeling, language modeling or source separationBonus: You have past experience creating high-performance implementations of deep learning algorithmsWhat's special about this role?Actually change lives at an unprecedented scale: How often do you hear about apps that make people cry of joy? It is really for us a unique opportunity and privilege to be able to meaningfully improve the lives of 100,000s of people - and yet to still be at the very beginning of our mission!Work with some of the best people in the world: We have an incredibly talented and passionate team that is a lot of fun to work with. We're still small and have accomplished some things that were thought impossible!Tackle our most interesting and impactful problems: Our AI team is growing very fast. You'd jump between machine-learning models, speech processing algorithms, internal tools, process — participating in every phase from inception to implementation. Absolutely no boredomJoin us at an incredible time: We're well-funded Series A company and hit product-market fit, which gives us a huge green field to work with. You'd join at the perfect time to shape what we build and how we grow, so we can create a more inclusive world

Any advance in this field unfolds numerous real-world applications. We are aspiring to bringing these advances closer to the reality by transforming them into the useful products potentially benefiting all humanity. We are part of cutting-edge research in the area currently focusing on following topics which may offer a way how to go beyond the iid hypothesis and more generally the assumption that the test cases come from the same distribution as the training set, so we can build more versatile AIs robust to changes in their environment. To achieve out-of-distribution robustness we explore two research directions. Causal learning i.e. figuring out what are the causal variables and how they are causally related, as this is a crucial part of understanding how the world works. Modularizing knowledge so it can be factorized into pieces that can be re-used for fast transfer and adaptation.  Responsibilities Manage research projects.Define and execute research projects by properly aligning goals and priorities with activities and resources required. Create project proposal and communicate key information to drive technical decisions. Prioritize work streams to manage and balance workload and intensity of technical project. Develop strategies and provide subject matter expertise. Propose, discuss, develop and implement novel and existing methods for out-of-distribution generalization in deep learning.  Write high quality and detailed research summaries. Discuss AI-related scientific papers. Discover new opportunities for further research. About you You have more than 3 years experience with neural networks research. Experience with out-of-distribution generalization of  neural networks.Experience with modular neural network architectures.Experience with causal learning using neural networks. Ability to read and understand AI-related scientific papers. You have solid background in deep learning scientific papers ideally related to modularity and causality.You have experience with a machine learning framework such as PyTorch, TensorFlow. You are passionate about your work for both technical merits and its strong purpose. Ability to work autonomously. Creative, open minded, continually self-improving and strive for innovative ideas. What we offer Employee Stock Option. A laptop of your choice & necessary tech is a given. Spacious & uncrowded office. 5 weeks of vacation, flexible working hours + 5 sick days. Competitive salary and a generous bonus model. Self-improvement – a day per week to study. No stress from redundant conference meetings/calls. Effective development & processes not delayed by bureaucracy. About us Machine learning team currently consisting of 2 people with a strategy to grow. As we are early phase startup you are going to be key element in decisions shaping our future, you will not be a mere small piece in a large team.  https://incieve.com/about/  Type: Full-time, Contract Possible start: Immediately or upon discussion Location: Remote or Prague on site

First off, let me give you some basic info:You’d be working on one of their contracts in Fort Meade, MD, spending 80% of the week onsite.Given the nature of the work, you’d need to have TS/SCI clearance, along with a Poly (CI and/or FSP) to get your foot in the door.(Unfortunately, this isn’t negotiable).Salary wise, I can see them paying up to $185,000 DOE.The packages include PTO (11 days, plus your birthday off), insurance cover (health, dental and vision), 401k/ESOP, life insurance, paid sabbaticals, and a healthy training budget to enhance your learning.So, why would you want to work here?Well, from the top down they’ve done everything they can to build a great training culture.Part of this includes providing lower billing targets, usually 32-36 hours per week (not 45-50 at some of the larger consultancies).This means you can spend more time focusing on yourself, with allocated time every week on your own development, working towards external certifications and taking exams.You’d also have free access to online courses.Every week, all staff are invited to attend learning lunches, usually headed up by a specialist within their field, to share knowledge across the board.Anyway, about the work.You’ll spend most of your time creating and deploying predictive models, typically from a wide variety of data sources and types using mathematical and statistical methods.You’ll work with stakeholders to understand the problems they’re trying to fix, exploring and wrangling data, writing re-usable code in R, Python, Java, Scala, SQL, etc. – this could mean preparing presentations, writing reports etc.If you could bring any consulting experience to the table then great, but it’d be nice if you could show exposure to Machine Learning techniques, NLP, Text Mining and ETL.If the role looks of interest, get in touch with Jack Leeming @ Optima Dev for a chat.

Passionné(e) par la Data et le Code, avec une forte appétence pour les défis, ce stage est fait pour vous.Vous intégrerez le Lab Lincoln et son équipe pluridisciplinaire qui vous encadrera et vous fera progresser durant vos 6 mois de stage.Projet : Identifier les différents faits énoncés dans un contenu vidéo et effectuer une vérification de leur véracité.Une multitude de contenus provenant de différentes sources d’information sont publiés et accessibles quotidiennement. Il est assez fréquent de se trouver confronté à des informations contradictoires sur un ensemble de sujets diminuant la confiance que l’on peut accorder à différents médias. Différents acteurs effectuent des vérifications (fact checking) manuelles de l’information avant de la publier, mais cela reste coûteux en temps et il n’est pas possible de couvrir tous les sujets. L’objectif de ce stage est d’imaginer et de mettre en place une méthodologie permettant de vérifier automatiquement les faits énoncés dans une vidéo en se basant sur une source de véracité (on utilisera probablement wikipédia pour la simplicité). Les éléments importants de ce projet seront les suivants : Identification de données pertinentes (documentaires, contenus youtube, contenu radio…)Veille technique et méthodologique en lien avec la problématiqueConception méthodologiqueRécupération des textes (speech to text)Découpage en domaines/sous domaines…Identification des ‘faits’ dans le texteComparaison à la sourceImplémentation et validation des algorithmesRefactoring et packaging des codesLa tâche sera à réaliser sur du contenu en langue française.Vous serez amené(e) à travailler dans le cloud (Azure). Déroulement du stage :· Mise en place des environnements· Collecte et exploration des données· Construction de la feuille de route méthodologique· Mise en œuvre de la méthodologie (labellisation, entraînement, évaluation)· Packaging des codes, rédaction de documentationAptitude, qualités requises :· Curiosité et force de proposition· Intérêt pour le domaine· Profil Ecole d'ingénieur· Appétence pour les problématiques Data Science. · Bonne connaissance de la programmation en Python· Niveau d'anglais suffisant pour la compréhension d'articles scientifiquesUn stage réussi débouchera sur un CDI vous permettant d'intégrer Lincoln et de participer au développement de notre activité conseil en Data science.

Fraud can cause financial losses for businesses and organizations, damage their reputation, and create legal and regulatory problems. There are different approaches how companies can prevent fraud in purchase order transactions. One step is to implement its own fraud detection software to identify patterns of fraudulent activity in financial transactions and alert its employees. Fraud detection algorithms typically analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns that are consistent with fraudulent behavior.Some Common Types Of Fraud Detection Algorithms Include Anomaly detection algorithms: algorithms identify transactions that are unusual or deviate from the norm. Rule-based algorithms: algorithms use a set of predefined rules to identify fraudulent transactions. Machine learning algorithms: algorithms use statistical techniques to analyze data and identify patterns that are indicative of fraudulent activity. Hybrid algorithms: algorithms combine elements of different types of algorithms to improve the accuracy of fraud detection.This internship involves working on a project using both supervised and unsupervised approaches to identify patterns in high-order data. It includes clustering/classification, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, graph and distributed data processing.Deliverablescode (python), numerical models, Internship presentation and report.Target Disciplines And Special Skills Penultimate or final year of MSc in Data Science or similar Engineering degree Oral and written communication skills in English Knowledge in applied mathematics, probability & statistics, manifold learning.

Passionné(e) par la Data et le Code, avec une forte appétence pour les défis, ce stage est fait pour vous.Vous intégrerez le Lab Lincoln et son équipe pluridisciplinaire qui vous encadrera et vous fera progresser durant vos 6 mois de stage.Projet : Comment rendre les modèles d’IA plus intelligibles et transparents sans pour autant faire de compromis sur les performances ?Le sujet de l'IA Explicable suscite beaucoup d’intérêt dans la communauté scientifique. Ceci s’explique principalement par l’utilisation massive des algorithmes d’apprentissage automatique (ML et DL), et plus particulièrement des méthodes dites « boîtes noires » qui privilégient la performance prédictive à la compréhension de leur fonctionnement et par conséquent de la décision préconisée.Le besoin de générer des explications compréhensibles par les humains reste un défi ouvert. Pour renforcer la confiance dans l’IA, il faut rendre les décisions préconisées par la machine explicables et transparentes L’IA Explicable se doit de répondre à ces deux principales questions clés :Comment fonctionne un algorithme ?Pourquoi l’algorithme prend telle ou telle décision ? L’objectif du stage est de poursuivre les travaux initiés en 2022 (état de l’art sur l’explicabilité des modèles de machine et deep learning et benchmark de méthodes appliquées à des cas d’usage « simples ») :· Mise à jour de l’état de l'art suivi de la sélection des approches jugées pertinentes pour réaliser les cas d’usage· Construction de 2 cas d’usage : définition de la problématique, identification et mise en place des jeux de données (données tabulaires dans un cas, données Image ou Textuel dans l’autre cas). Apprentissage ML et DL si nécessaire.· Mise en œuvre des méthodes d’explicabilité des modèles sur chaque cas d’usage. Analyse critique des résultats. Adaptation si nécessaire des méthodes existantes· Conception et développement d’un outil graphique interactif (Shiny, Dash, React, Streamlit…) permettant de traduire les modèles IA dans un langage compréhensible et utile pour l’utilisateur· Rédaction de notes méthodologiques et partage de connaissances avec l'équipe Conseil & InnovationAptitude, qualités requises :· Rigueur, Curiosité, motivation, proactivité et agilité technique· Appétence pour la recherche scientifique : état de l’art, méthodologie, rédaction· Qualité pour vulgariser des approches complexes, pour transposer une démarche scientifique en un outil visuel et synthétique d’aide à l’explicabilité des modèles IA · Très bon niveau en programmation Python . Niveau d'anglais suffisant pour la compréhension d'articles scientifiquesUn stage réussi débouchera sur un CDI vous permettant d'intégrer Lincoln et de participer au développement de notre activité conseil en Data science.

Passionné(e) par la Data et le Code, avec une forte appétence pour les défis, ce stage est fait pour vous.Vous intégrerez le Lab Lincoln et son équipe pluridisciplinaire qui vous encadrera et vous fera progresser durant vos 6 mois de stage.Projet : Identifier et localiser les différents éléments d'un document scanné, stocker et structurer l'information.Les entreprises peuvent posséder un important patrimoine de document scannés. Leur exploitation est complexe, car leur qualité est variable et les outils de recherche informatiques sont très peu efficaces sur ce type d’information. Dans le but d’améliorer leur exploitation, il faut être en mesure d’identifier leur contenu, tant dans la forme que dans le fond. Les méthodes d’OCR permettent d’extraire assez facilement le texte de ces documents, mais pas leur structure, et cela présente des complexités pour les exploiter (recherche d’information, mise en correspondance de valeurs issues de tableaux …).L’objectif de ce stage est de construire un package python disposant de différentes fonctionnalités d’extraction de structure de document, afin de construire un ensemble de métadonnées au plus proche de la réalité du document. Afin de parvenir à réaliser cet objectif, il faudra construire un pipeline de traitement adapté à tout type de document. Les éléments importants de ce projet seront les suivants : Identification des différents éléments dans un document : tableaux, figures, signatures, pagination…Veille technique et méthodologique en lien avec la problématiqueChoix des outils et algorithmes adaptésLabellisation des donnéesImplémentation et validation des algorithmesConstruction des pipelines de traitementRefactoring et packaging des codesUn ensemble de plusieurs centaines de documents (contenant plusieurs pages) de contenus variés sera mis à disposition pour mettre en place et évaluer les performances des traitements implémentés.Vous serez amené(e) à travailler dans le cloud (Azure). Déroulement du stage :· Mise en place des environnements· Analyse et exploration de la base documentaire· Construction des objectifs du package (méthodologie + cible)· Mise en œuvre de la méthodologie (labellisation, entraînement, évaluation)· Packaging des codes, rédaction de documentationAptitude, qualités requises :· Curiosité et force de proposition· Intérêt pour le domaine· Profil Ecole d'ingénieur· Appétence pour les problématiques Data Science. · Bonne connaissance de la programmation en Python· Niveau d'anglais suffisant pour la compréhension d'articles scientifiquesUn stage réussi débouchera sur un CDI vous permettant d'intégrer Lincoln et de participer au développement de notre activité conseil en Data science.
