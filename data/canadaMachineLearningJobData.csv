At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

Mappedin is the leading platform for indoor spatial data management, digitizing venues, and building best-in-class indoor mapping experiences. Built for scale, our platform enables us to work with leading operators and developers around the world. Mappedin operates in over 1,300 venues across 40+ countries and our Map Editor powers accurate wayfinding experiences across more than 800 million square feet of indoor space.

In 2022, Mappedin launched a new product for first responders which is now being piloted in multiple cities, along with expanding its platform product across new venues such as The Australian Grand Prix. Recently named one of Canada’s Top Growing Companies for 2022 in the Globe and Mail Report on Business ranking, Mappedin earned its spot with three-year growth of 158%. With over 70 employees and more hiring to come, Mappedin is well-positioned for growth.

Mappedin’s Product and Platform team is a group of developers responsible for Mappedin’s core products used by tens of millions of people: Our Pre-Built Mapping Applications, Developer Tools, and Indoor Mapping Software.

Media:


You want to work with a team of developers that use machine learning to solve hard problems in real world, production environments. You understand ML techniques, but know that a cool model is nothing until you get it integrated into a great app used by actual users, with plans and tools to keep it up to date.

You’ll be joining the Super Auto team at Mappedin, which is a feature team comprised of Machine Learning, Front End, and Full Stack developers. They can take a new ML-powered tool from inception all the way to production, and keep it fresh once it’s deployed. As a Machine Learning Developer you will help bridge the gap between pure machine learning and feature deployment.

You are highly interested in learning about or already have experience in:


We understand that not everyone will be familiar with the tech stack or will check all of the boxes above. We would still love for you to apply and we will provide support if required!


You’ll need to know a bit about a bunch of different things. We don’t expect you to be an expert in coming up with the right ML technique to use for a given problem, but we do expect you to be able to pick up how to best help train, use, deploy, and maintain it. Most of Mappedin’s codebase is written in TypeScript, but the ML is done in Python, so you will end up using both languages, and the more you can push to TypeScript the more the rest of the Dev team can contribute.

Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.

Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.


We run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.

We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.

There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We are a REMOTE company. If you’re local, there will probably be a few days a week when you can expect other people to be in the office, but this role could also be fully remote. We work flexible hours, have a flexible vacation policy and work to provide the hardware or office equipment you require to unleash your potential. We will do what it takes to get things done if we said we would do it. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.

Mappedin welcomes applications from people with disabilities. We provide reasonable accommodations for candidates upon request through the recruitment process. For additional information, please email us at accessibility@mappedin.com or call us at (519) 594-0102 and ask to speak to a member of the Human Resources team.

We build AI robots and are on a mission to repurpose 1,000,000 hours to higher and more meaningful work.

Every year, billions of hours are wasted on repetitive and manual work. This is work that can and should be automated, but has been overlooked. Quandri is building robots to fix this.

Our robot fleet enables our customers, currently insurance brokers, to automate many of their most time-consuming and repetitive processes by handing them off to a software robot. These software robots can be deployed into a customer’s software systems and work within their processes similar to how a person would, but at lightning speed and for a fraction of the cost.

We’re beginning by tackling massive problems around repetitive and high-volume work in the insurance industry, but will be expanding outwards to other industries over the next few years where this technology can have an even larger impact. We’ve recently raised venture capital from US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission of optimizing the workforce. We're growing fast, and will 10X our annual recurring revenue in 2022 compared to 2021.

We’re a hybrid company, with an office space in Gastown (with an AMAZING view of the North Shore) that we expect people to be at 3 days a week.



As a Backend Python Engineer, you will be responsible for building robust, scalable software robots. In this role, you’ll have a direct impact on our products and customers. The work you do will affect customers’ immediately, and you’ll see firsthand how much your work can improve their day-to-day lives.

If you enjoy being challenged, thrive when working autonomously, think with a customer-first mindset and approach problems from a first-principles approach, then this is probably a good fit. If you want to take marching orders, work on small features of massive products and don’t want a high level of direct responsibility, then this probably isn’t a fit.

Our engineers are dedicated to learning, continuous self-improvement, regularly handle support tickets and think long-term about solving problems in the best way for customers.





We want to meet people with 2-5 years of Python engineering experience, excluding co-ops. Where you went to school and what company you worked for doesn’t matter. It’s more important to us that you are a great problem solver, write high quality code and build from a customer first perspective.

We start by asking customers a few questions, so our system can learn about their needs; from there, our ground-breaking, proprietary platform takes over and analyzes the thousands of data points that make customers unique. This is how we create custom-tailored plans for each customer; plans built precisely for their needs and budget. Our platform serves as the intersection between customer and seller, technology, and the human touch.

At Assurance, we are innovative, persevering, collaborative, calculated, and authentic, and we're working together to improve the lives of millions!



As we build the future of consumer insurance in a modern age, data is at the core of everything that we do. The role requires team members who are adept at using large data sets to find opportunities for optimization and can leverage appropriate models to test the effectiveness of different courses of action. Our team uses a variety of data mining and analysis methods, a variety of data tools, builds and implements models, develops algorithms, and creates simulations. At Assurance, we hire experts in their field, and we give them the independence and trust to build based on their expertise.

This position is responsible for writing production-ready code to include testing and maintenance infrastructure; you must be able to put models and analysis into production with no support from engineering (we own our stack end to end). The ideal candidate has a proven ability to drive business results with data-based insights, and is comfortable working with a wide range of stakeholders and functional teams. The right candidate will have a passion for discovering solutions hidden in large data sets and working with stakeholders to improve business outcomes. You’re capable of getting data for analysis on your own, without reliance on engineering, and you can build professional dashboards as standalone software products and tools. We’re growing at a rapid pace, so it’s important that you embrace the opportunity to blaze your own trail.

We believe in an honest and transparent approach with our teammates. Company wide weekly Town Halls, All Hands and strategy meetings are just a few ways in which we encourage an open and honest path to achieving complete transparency.

Despite a pandemic, there isn’t a day where we don’t feel connected to one another.

With frequent events, workshops, giveaways, slack coffee and donut sessions we have definitely brought on our office culture to this new virtual world of zoom calls.

We also try to cater for all our staff’s needs – be that a freshly brewed cappuccino made by our professional barista in our free coffee shop or by providing a bountiful supply of tasty snacks to keep us refueled and buzzing.

We love to organise plenty of social get-togethers and action-packed activity days, be it slipping inside an inflatable bumper ball for a mad session of football zorbing or throwing caution to the wind and traversing giddy treetop rope courses at Go Ape. On top of these team-building activities, our lunch and learn workshops, not to mention the lavish Christmas and summer parties, foster that ‘work hard, play hard’ mantra. Our offices are based in the heart of the metropolises of London and Lviv, surrounded by an abundance of diversity and inspiration to keep those ideas flowing.



We have the deepest respect for our people and their well being. We know they are exceptionally talented and will always have a choice. We want them to re-choose us every day. We are committed to building a culture where each person's voice will always be heard and addressed.

Always improving, innovating and never settling for the existing. We push all boundaries with courage and ambition to become the world’s best games company.

We are all Equal - regardless of the language we speak, where we live, our gender, religion or culture we come from. We want to build a global home, where everyone has the equal opportunity to make an impact.

We always think from the customer's perspective - be it players or internal customers.

Improving their experience and joy is what drives us. Every client's success is our big win!"

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 53k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

We build AI robots and are on a mission to repurpose 1,000,000 hours to higher and more meaningful work.

Every year, billions of hours are wasted on repetitive and manual work. This is work that can and should be automated, but has been overlooked. Quandri is building robots to fix this.

Our robot fleet enables our customers, currently insurance brokers, to automate many of their most time-consuming and repetitive processes by handing them off to a software robot. These software robots can be deployed into a customer’s software systems and work within their processes similar to how a person would, but at lightning speed and for a fraction of the cost.

We’re beginning by tackling massive problems around repetitive and high-volume work in the insurance industry, but will be expanding outwards to other industries over the next few years where this technology can have an even larger impact. We’ve recently raised venture capital from US and Canadian investors to help us achieve our mission of optimizing the workforce. We're growing fast, and will 10X our annual recurring revenue in 2022 compared to 2021.

We’re a hybrid company, with an office space in Gastown (with an AMAZING view of the North Shore) that we expect people to be at 3 days a week.



As a Backend Python Engineer, you will be responsible for building robust, scalable software robots. In this role, you’ll have a direct impact on our products and customers. The work you do will affect customers’ immediately, and you’ll see firsthand how much your work can improve their day-to-day lives.

If you enjoy being challenged, thrive when working autonomously, think with a customer-first mindset and approach problems from a first-principles approach, then this is probably a good fit. If you want to take marching orders, work on small features of massive products and don’t want a high level of direct responsibility, then this probably isn’t a fit.

Our engineers are dedicated to learning, continuous self-improvement, regularly handle support tickets and think long-term about solving problems in the best way for customers.





We want to meet people with 2-5 years of Python engineering experience, excluding co-ops. Where you went to school and what company you worked for doesn’t matter. It’s more important to us that you are a great problem solver, write high quality code and build from a customer first perspective.









Don’t let imposter syndrome stop you from applying. Great people sometimes don’t have the “right” experience. If you think that you’ll be amazing at this role then apply."

We work at the intersection of fundamental research and industrial applications, with the goal of publishing our research at the most elite scientific venues and having a product impact on Samsung.

One area of interest for us is image manipulation on mobile phones. With the recent advances in computational photography, mobile phones can already take photos of exceptional quality. We aim to further improve on that quality and add exciting new image manipulation capabilities using modern computer vision and ML tools, such as burst photography, GANs, and implicit representations. We are looking for junior research scientists and PhD interns who are interested in working with us on this exciting problem. Ideal candidates would already have some exposure to low-level computer vision and ML tools, be motivated to work on cutting-edge research with practical applications, and be strong independent researchers.

Another area of interest is video understanding, including searching and interacting with instructional videos, livestream video task monitoring, and activity modelling and recognition. Addressing these challenges in a weakly supervised, real-time setting not only requires a deep understanding of cutting-edge ML and CV tools and techniques, but also the creative combination of visual and linguistic modalities, as well as addressing challenges in human-AI interaction. We are looking for experienced researchers with a strong background in the above-mentioned subfields of AI, along with a curiosity to learn how to bring these pieces together to solve real-world problems.

Citylitics delivers predictive intelligence on local utility & public infrastructure markets

What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.

Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.

Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the market & opportunity intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

What are we looking for?

We are looking for a Data Engineer with an ownership mindset where they can take a challenging data problem all the way through to an elegant tech solution that is robust and scalable.

ProteinQure is a seed-stage company and has raised its seed round of USD $4M led by top Silicon Valley and Canadian investors.

We're looking for a Machine Learning Lead to join our team in Toronto (Canada). You should think about joining us if you enjoy the balance of creating state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms but being evaluated by real-world impact. Our deliverables are molecules, not models. This is a player-coach role and will require a contribution to individual projects as well as managing a growing team.

ProteinQure is an interdisciplinary team and you will interact with world class experts in a variety of domains.




Nice to haves






Benefits at ProteinQure include medical, dental and vision insurance and health spending account, which you can use on gym memberships or massages. We believe in enabling our employees to be their most productive selves - from extremely ergonomic chairs to standing desks and powerful, portable laptops. Employees are encouraged to buy (and get a refund for) equipment, books, or whatever tools that would make their work life easier.

The office is situated in downtown Toronto, with plenty of great restaurants nearby. Toronto is a great cultural hub (film festivals, theatres, museums and concerts) and supports active lifestyle (amateur sports leagues, waterfront beaches, surfing or even (ice) climbing). Canadian nature offers options for calming retreats and the country is very diverse, welcoming and open to newcomers.

The team composition is roughly 40% software engineers and data scientists, 40% computational biologists, medicinal chemists (including experimentalists performing experiments in wet lab) and 20% business and administration.

Celebration of diversity of all forms is embedded in our culture. Great work is the result of diverse thinking and experiences and we have a workplace where those differences can thrive. Over two thirds of the team was born outside of Canada.

Collaborative learning is at heart of what we do at ProteinQure - we have weekly lunch and learns (often with guest lecturers from outside of the company), attend (and organize!) meetups and hackathons and educate each other about best practices. We support our employees and sponsor attendance to conferences or professional events (up to $3000 a year).

Ownership of work is fundamental to way we operate. People will encourage you to problem solve and figure out how to best deliver results. You’re completely free to take vacation (and run errands) as long as you are responsible and performing. The last thing we want to do is micromanage our team. We try empower our employees, trust them to deliver and hold them accountable.

Our hiring process consists of three steps:



We will give you our decision within 5 business days of the on-site interview. For the international candidates, we sponsor visas and help with relocation."

DESCRIPTION

Amazon internships are full-time positions, and interns should expect to work Monday-Friday, up to 40 hours per week typically between 8am-5pm. Specific team norms around working hours will be communicated by your manager. Interns should not have conflicts such as classes or other employment during the Amazon work-day.

Applicants should have a minimum of one school term remaining in their studies after their internship concludes. Applicants will be considered for all SDE roles through this application. We will take your internship season and location preferences into consideration based on business availability. Please note that a majority of our internships take place in the summer.





At Amazon, we hire the best minds in technology to innovate and build on behalf of our customers. The intense focus we have on our customers is why we are one of the world’s most beloved brands – customer obsession is part of our company DNA. Our interns write real software and collaborate with a select group of experienced software development engineers (SDEs) who guide interns on projects that matter to our customers.

As an intern, you will be matched to a manager and a mentor. You will have the opportunity to influence the evolution of Amazon technology and lead mission critical projects early in your career. Your design, code, and raw smarts will contribute to solving some of the most complex technical challenges in the areas of distributed systems, data mining, automation, optimization, scalability, and security – just to name a few.

No matter the location of your internship, we give you the tools to own your project and learn in a real-world setting.

As a Generalist Lead Data Scientist at Very, you will work with our Software, Hardware, and Product Design teams to build full-service solutions for our clients. We focus on building end-to-end hardware and software solutions that meet our client's business needs, and reliable machine learning systems are often a part of our offering. An ideal candidate will display technical expertise in machine learning and data science, as well as strong communication skills, and the ability to present ideas and results to audiences ranging in technical depth. Candidates should also have experience translating business problems into analytical solutions, working in interdisciplinary teams, and building ML models for production systems.

What You’ll Be Working On

At Very, there is a never-ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. However, it is critical to note that almost all of these projects are production systems. As such, the only consistent research component of this position will revolve around establishing a pattern of delivery that allows the team to implement full-scale applications leveraging machine learning in a fast, predictable manner.

You’ll spend 80-90% of your time working on products or platforms for one of our clients, and the other 10-20% of your time will be spent improving Very’s Data Science Practice. This will involve:



As a lead data scientist, you will be expected to not only understand the following analytical approaches but also be able to guide others in their implementation:

Our build teams operate with a very high degree of collaboration, so you will definitely have run-ins with these stacks throughout your time here:



As an IoT technology company our data science pipelines include “Things”. This will require you to build pipelines and deploy analytical models to hardware on the edge in addition to the cloud. This requires a deep collaboration with the design, software and hardware teams in the following environments:



At Very we have two types of lead positions; a specialist and generalist. Both positions go beyond the mastery of the core Data Science competencies to include a leadership position. The specialist lead focuses in great depth in one or more areas of Data Science and spreads that mastery across Very. The generalist lead takes a more multi-disciplinary approach and leads multi-disciplinary projects from a technical perspective.

This dramatically increases the office’s ability to schedule appointments and manage their patient’s healthcare.

Research Associate


McKeown Laboratory Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre Division of Neurology | Department of Medicine | Faculty of Medicine (Martin McKeown)


January 6, 2023

Note: Applications will be accepted until 11:59 PM on the day prior to the Posting End Date above.

This position is located within a health-care facility, therefore, the successful candidate will be required to provide verification of full vaccination against Covid-19 provided prior to the start date, as required by a provincial health mandate.

Research Associate


The Pacific Parkinson’s Research Centre (PPRC) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) is searching for a highly qualified Research Associate (RA) to join our research team, led by Dr. Martin J. McKeown. This position focuses on discovering and implementing novel interventions aimed at remediating motor and non-motor functions (e.g., cognition) in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD); with a special interest in understanding the neural mechanisms of intervention effects.

The successful candidate will work closely with Dr. McKeown on research studies that involve non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) using low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation (LI-FUS) and multimodal neuroimaging such as MRI, EEG, and PET. LI-FUS is a novel NIBS technique using acoustic energy and is currently in a rapid phase of investigation as a neuromodulation tool. LI-FUS has a high potential to be a viable neuromodulation tool to make changes in neural circuits. To utilize LI-FUS to improve PD symptoms, the successful candidate will need to setup, troubleshoot, and operate a sophisticated LI-FUS machine that provides unprecedented spatial resolution and penetration depth for brain stimulation. It is anticipated that accurate models of brain structure and function will be necessary to customize stimulation profiles. Thus, experience with large brain imaging data sets and Machine Learning algorithms will be highly desirable.

The RA will play a key role in the success of the neuromodulation studies including: hypotheses generation, study design, equipment setup, analyzing data (neuroimaging and behavioural), statistical analyses and interpretation, presentation of findings to colleagues, international conferences and potential donors, and drafting and publication of scientific manuscripts and grant writing. The RA will work largely independently but within a team comprised of researchers, postdoctoral fellows, research staff, and students. The RA will also help mentor and supervise trainees and undergraduate/graduate students working on these (or related) projects.

Responsibilities will include, but will not be limited to:

The study uses neurophysiological techniques (EEG and EMG) to investigate sensorimotor processing and its development in children with dystonia and DCP, aiming to improve outcomes. The work will provide robust scientific understanding of sensorimotor development and how its disruption in early life leads to dystonia / DCP. This new knowledge is essential if we are to intervene with neuromodulatory techniques early enough in life to exploit critical windows of development and thereby harness neuroplasticity to prevent or ameliorate disability.

Job Description

You know the moment. It’s the first notes of that song you love, the intro to your favorite movie, or simply the sound of someone you love saying “hello.” It’s in these moments that sound matters most.

At Bose, we believe sound is the most powerful force on earth. And we’ve dedicated ourselves to improving it for nearly 60 years. Ever since our founder, Dr. Amar Bose, bought a stereo system and thought, “I can make this better,” we’ve been relentlessly pushing forward to the next best thing.

Innovation is more than what we do. It’s who we are — constantly learning and constantly curious. We never stop imagining what better sound sounds like. We’re music fanatics and audio engineers. We’re explorers and inventors and dreamers. And we’re passionate down to our bones about making whatever you’re listening to a little more magical.


We're looking for students to join our Co-Op Program who are obsessively curious about 'what's next'. You'll get hands on experience with our products and learn from the best of the best in the business. You will immerse yourself into Bose for 6 months and get the opportunity to grow the skills your learned in the classroom with hands on work experience. By the time you end your time with us, you will have been given the opportunity to truly make a real impact in the future of Bose and your career!

Opportunities don't stop at your day-to-day work. While you're getting an in depth look at your area of expertise, we'll expose you to other areas of the company. Our Co-Ops are given the opportunity to connect with senior leadership across the business to understand different perspectives at Bose. You'll network with other Co-Ops and colleagues to grow your network for the future!

Timeframe - January-June 2023


The goal of our team is to research and develop novel AI-powered audio processing algorithms. The twist is that our algorithms must run in real-time, on physical devices, for applications such as voice pickup, hearing augmentation and ones we haven't even thought of yet. As part of the team, you will work with experts in deep learning, digital signal processing, software engineering and psychoacoustics to prototype and implement new algorithms.

Current research interests of our group include machine learning (ML) methods for single- and multi-channel audio signal processing, source separation, perceptually-optimal speech enhancement, lightweight, low-latency ML models for low-resource devices, and related topics.

Bose has a strong history of combining creative thinking with ground breaking technology in the audio domain. We are looking for candidates passionate about machine learning and audio to help us shape the next chapter in the future of Bose!

Team members can work primarily remotely in the United States, Canada, Ukraine, Germany, Poland, or Portugal. Conditions permitting, teams will meet in person a few weeks every quarter at one of Grammarly's hubs in San Francisco, Kyiv, New York, Vancouver, and Berlin, or in a workspace in Kraków.

We believe this balanced, flexible approach gives our team members the best of both worlds: plenty of focus time along with in-person collaboration that fosters trust, unlocks creativity, and further fuels innovation.

Grammarly team members in this role must be based in the United States or Canada.


Every day, tens of millions of people and 50,000 professional teams rely on Grammarly’s AI-enabled communication assistance to help them communicate confidently and achieve their goals. Our team members have the autonomy to take on exciting challenges in pursuit of our mission to improve lives by improving communication. Together, we’re building on more than a decade of steady growth and profitability. We’re defining the communication assistance category for individuals, enterprises, and developers with tailored service offerings: Grammarly Premium , Grammarly Business , Grammarly for Education , and Grammarly for Developers . All of this begins with our team collaborating in an inclusive, values-driven, and learning-oriented environment.

Until now, our product has provided a largely uniform, identical experience to all its users. As we strive to define and advance the communication-assistant market, it’s become essential for our product to deliver a context-aware and personalized experience to every user. This requires understanding users’ intent, style, and communication preferences. Similarly, the Text Editor software development kit, Grammarly’s first developer offering, will provide contextually personalized experiences tailored to the app's communication use case and further empower our partners.

We are looking for a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in recommendation, relevance, or personalization to build these capabilities. This person will apply ML to solve new and challenging problems, as well as build the infrastructure and systems to operate solutions effectively at scale. This will involve working on a highly cross-functional team, in close partnership with Analytical Linguists, Computational Linguists, Data Scientists, and more.

Grammarly’s engineers, researchers, and ML practitioners have the freedom to innovate and uncover breakthroughs—and, in turn, influence our product roadmap. They will have the chance to broaden and deepen their skills in machine learning and deep learning. Read more about our stack or hear from our team on our technical blog .


As a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in personalization, you will have a significant customer-facing impact, including defining the personalized customer experience and working closely with Grammarly for Developers partners. Personalization is a top strategic goal for Grammarly. Most of the problems we’re tackling haven’t been solved before, which provides the opportunity for creative and innovative problem-solving.

Robin AI is an exciting, venture-backed technology start-up using software, artificial intelligence and human intelligence to make contracts simple. Robin was established in 2019 by CEO Richard Robinson (a former City lawyer) and Chief Technology Officer James Clough (a theoretical physicist who works in Machine Learning) and is backed by some of the world’s most impressive companies and investors, including Forward Partners, Episode One, Google and Softbank.

At Robin AI, we create ground-breaking products that are transforming legal work. Our work is multi-disciplinary and brings together the best talent in engineering, AI and the law. At the heart of our offering is a traditional legal service which is being enhanced by cutting edge machine learning. We are looking for a bright legal mind to help us provide a world-class experience to our customers, help establish and expand our presence in North America, support the development of our junior team members and maintain our exceptionally high service delivery standards.



This role is within the Legal and Product Team at Robin, and will involve working directly with investment teams at some of the world’s largest private equity and debt funds, financial institutions and corporates as they explore transaction opportunities. As an experienced legal professional, you will have responsibility for reviewing and negotiating transactional documents, alongside the opportunity to hire and develop junior talent. In addition, Robin offers fantastic opportunities for personal career development in a variety of areas alongside traditional legal work, including client onboarding and management, product development and ongoing customer success.

We are expanding our North American presence, with the goal of opening a standalone Toronto office.

This role will suit an experienced legal professional (who is a qualified solicitor) who might be considering a position within a legal team at an investment bank, fund or asset management company. At Robin we are proud to call a large number of these institutions our clients, and our core transactional work covers many of the same areas and document types – but we work in a much more modern, creative and flexible way!








You will have at least 1-3 years’ experience drafting, reviewing and negotiating the core transactional documents regularly encountered by our clients (including confidentiality agreements, engagement letters and release letters). You will have previously worked with private equity, asset management or hedge fund clients, whether in-house, at a service provider or at a law firm, and will understand typical fund transaction structures and timelines.

You will enjoy taking the initiative and seeking answers to interesting practical and legal issues. You will be technical and commercial, both in the practice of law and outside of it. You will be interested in developing your client management skills at a faster pace than might be possible elsewhere, and ideally you’ll be looking forward to taking ownership of some of our client relationships in due course. Last (but certainly not least), you will be motivated by working in a fast-paced, diverse and intellectually challenging environment where collaboration between lawyers and non-lawyers is essential to achieving results.




We are deliberate about the culture we are building, and are committed to creating an inclusive environment that attracts the best talent from diverse backgrounds. Whether it’s helping curate the Robin Spotify playlist, discussing gender equality in tech, or taking a meditation break with our holistic health plan, we want you to find your space within the Robin community.

Through our relationship with WeWork, you’ll have access to all of the WeWork amenities available on site.



We want to break diversity, inclusion and equality barriers within the tech industry. In building our team, we welcome the unique contributions that you can bring, and welcome applications regardless of ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, education, opinions, nation of origin, languages spoken, age, pregnancy and maternity, or veteran’s status."

We have two amazing products to make this real:

Sequence, which consists of i) the first user-friendly smart wallet for crypto, NFTs, Web3 + the metaverse, and ii) a developer platform to make building Web3 applications easy on Ethereum and other EVM chains.

And Skyweaver, a digital trading card game—powered by Sequence—where players can win, own, trade and sell their NFT game items.

Sequence is poised to drive Web3 adoption on a massive scale by making blockchain easy, fun and powerful for users and developers. And, Skyweaver is a groundbreaking video game with an unprecedented player-owned economy, novel gameplay, and an already fervent community.

While the challenge is hard, we find it incredibly fun. And, we have the ingredients to make it happen: a well-capitalized company with some of the best investors in the world (Reddit co-founder, Coinbase, Initialized, and more), an amazing team of leaders in the blockchain space, engineers who have built widely popular open source, a former top McKinsey strategy consultant, gaming industry veterans, and founders who have built and sold successful companies. You'll get to work with and learn from them all. Learn more at https://horizon.io/

Who we're looking for

The focus of this role is leading our data analytics efforts across various products: Analyzing large amounts of blockchain data on the Ethereum blockchain, and related sidechains, like Polygon, for our Sequence products; and player game data in Skyweaver, a digital trading card game.

You will have a front-row seat to a fascinating sector---Web3, blockchain gaming---working alongside some of the best Web3 thinkers, in a sector with massive growth. This role will oversee the work of a team of 2-4+ team members (data analysts and data scientists), provide direction, and review analysis.

As a Team Lead, you will work directly with leadership and other team leads, working with them to drive actionable outcomes through data. Your leadership will span Product, Marketing, and Finance, bridging data needs, and working to run analyzes. You will translate how the questions asked by teams can be answered through data, helping them move fast, be effective, and be impactful.

Eventually, your team will drive insights, proactively uncovering patterns hidden in our data that help drive business outcomes.

Importantly, we value colleagues who are helpful, humble, and collaborative. You will be well supported, and surrounded by a team that will nurture your success.

This work focuses on development of a clinical device known as the Advanced System for Implant Stability Testing (ASIST) for non-invasive evaluation of the bone-implant interface in lower limb osseointegrated implants. The ASIST isolates the interface properties by measuring the acceleration upon impact with the implant system, in combination with an analytical model that is based on vibration theory. We aim to apply this technique in the clinic to track the stability of the bone-implant interface over the time, thereby providing a method to detect early loosening of the implant.

We are seeking a research associate to develop the next generation ASIST unit, with a particular focus on lower limb implants. The successful candidate will work in an inter-disciplinary team including electrical and mechanical engineers, graduate students, and clinicians.


Working under the supervision of the CoPI (Westover) with additional reporting responsibilities to the grant PI (Hebert), the Research Associate will work within a team to manage and enact the requirements and engineering deliverables of this project. Activities include:

At Deloitte, we are driven to inspire and help our people, organization, communities, and country to thrive. Our Purpose is to build a better future by accelerating and expanding access to knowledge. Purpose defines who we are and gives us reason to exist as an organization.

Enjoy flexible, proactive, and practical benefits that foster a culture of well-being and connectedness.

Be empowered to lead and have impact with clients, our communities and in the office.

Be expected to share your ideas and to make them a reality.

Steve Jobs said it best… “Get closer than ever to your customers. So close that you tell them what they need well before they realize it themselves.” Voice of Client is here to help listen, analyze and share the valuable information that our clients tell us, to all our teams, in an effort to drive us to a Category of One!



Voice of Client is a team/initiative leading our firm around how we collect, analyze, and share client insights to improve all aspects of our firm’s business (what we do, and how we do it) – we care about clients. Our team values data and innovative approaches to analyzing and sharing that data. Knowing that there are many experts in our firm, we connect with other teams to learn best practices and ways of working to excel our own work. Our entire goal is to provide value to our clients … the various teams within the firm, so they can in turn do the same for their clients!

A typical day looks like…



Voice of Client is a small, tightknit team. With 3-5 people on the direct team, we work directly with over 20 other people across the firm (and MANY more indirectly) to make this very important program a reality.

We act very much like a start-up where we lend help where help is needed. Part of the benefit of being on a longer-term project is getting to know your team – the people, their stories, what drives them, and how we can all work together to help each other with our longer-term goals. We are open, transparent, and drive to produce top quality work. Our work matters to us and to this firm.







We are a group of talented people who want to learn, gain experience, and develop skills. Wherever you are in your career, we want you to advance.



Diverse perspectives and life experiences make us better. Whoever you are and wherever you’re from, we want you to feel like you belong here. We provide flexible working options to support you and how you can contribute. Be the leader you want to be.



Some guide teams, some change culture, some build essential expertise. We offer opportunities and experiences that support your continuing growth as a leader.



We are uniquely able to offer you new challenges and roles – and prepare you for them. We bring together people with unique experiences and talents, and we are the place to develop a lasting network of friends, peers, and mentors. Our TVP is about relationships – between leaders and their people, the firm and its people, peers, and within in our communities.



At Deloitte, we are all about doing business inclusively – that starts with having diverse colleagues of all abilities. Deloitte encourages applications from all qualified candidates who represent the full diversity of communities across Canada. This includes, but is not limited to, people with disabilities, candidates from Indigenous communities, and candidates from the Black community in support of living our values, creating a culture of Diversity Equity and Inclusion and our commitment to our AccessAbility Action Plan , Reconciliation Action Plan and the BlackNorth Initiative .

We encourage you to connect with us at accessiblecareers@deloitte.ca if you require an accommodation for the recruitment process (including alternate formats of materials, accessible meeting rooms or other accommodations). We’d love to hear from you!

. You can also choose to work from our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC.

This position is open to experienced candidates with a track record in this area. We’re building up our data warehouse and analysis skills, and we’re looking for someone who knows how to analyze, recommend, deploy, and use tools and techniques to help us get the most out of our data!


As a Data Engineer, you’ll help foster informed decision making and innovation within ActiveState by making our data understandable, actionable, and available in the relevant contexts.

You’ll be a part of our Tools and Infrastructure team, and will work closely with our in-house Data Analyst and with most of our other teams from time to time, both inside and outside of Engineering.





Our team is mostly scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Zoom for video calls and screen sharing, Asana for task management, and Google Drive.

We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code.




If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:


ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all of us.

Our company is a team of 68+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events. While we have great office spaces in Vancouver, Canada, we're very distributed and remote first.

Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly aren’t lacking ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches. For more about working at ActiveState and our Glassdoor rating go to www.activestate.com/careers .

At KPMG, you’ll join a team of diverse and dedicated problem solvers, connected by a common cause turning insight into opportunity for clients and communities around the world.

Do work that matters, supported by a community that values difference and cares about you. Gain learning that’ll last you a lifetime and be recognized for the impact you make. With a focus on encouraging employees to come as they are, KPMG provides its employees with a variety of unique tools and support systems that ensure they thrive and make their mark in their career and in their communities



At KPMG, we think like an investor, looking at how opportunities to buy, sell, fund or fix a company can add and preserve value.

Today’s deals do not happen in a vacuum. So from client business strategy to acquisition strategy, plans for divestments or for raising funds, or even needs to restructure, every decision must be made in light of the clients entire business, sector, and the global economy.

Our teams of specialists combine a global mindset and local experience with deep sector knowledge and superior analytic tools to help clients navigate the complex, fragmented process of mergers and acquisitions.

From helping clients plan and implement strategic change to measurably increasing portfolio value, we focus on delivering tangible results through transaction advisory services and deal advisory services. The kind of results that let you clearly see what you gained from the deal at hand, and what you want to bring to the next deal down the road. Real results, achieved by integrated specialists.



Corporate deal teams and financial investors are facing unprecedented pressure. The M&A market is highly competitive, massive and increasing amounts of data need to be analyzed for due diligence and deal timelines have shortened dramatically. The time pressure and scope of the task can leave buyers and sellers wondering if they’ve missed risks or opportunities. Since all bidders have access to the same data, it’s increasingly difficult to find a competitive edge.

KPMG Deal Analytics helps clients strengthen their deal conviction. We merge advanced analytic methodologies and proprietary automated data analysis tools with our deep industry knowledge and global reach to perform thorough due diligence at deal speed and generate actionable insights that can be used for post-deal value creation. We provide clients with unbiased answers to your questions and identify and answer the non-obvious questions that other buyers aren’t asking.

At RBC, our culture is deeply supportive and rich in opportunity and reward. You will help our clients thrive and our communities prosper, empowered by a spirit of shared purpose.

Whether you’re helping clients find new opportunities, developing new technology, or providing expert advice to internal partners, you will be doing work that matters in the world, in an environment built on teamwork, service, responsibility, diversity, and integrity.


2023 Summer Student, Global Risk Analytics



Global Risk Analytics (GRA) is the center of expertise for models used in risk measurement of market and counterparty credit risk for trading book. Given the increasing importance of assessing the financial impacts of climate change to financial institutions, GRA is also building expertise in climate risk analytics to support RBC’s various climate risk stress testing and scenario analysis mandates (e.g., CCAR in US, ICAAP in UK).

In particular, GRA has model development ownership for several regional climate risk scenario analysis models, covering both transition risk (posed to clients in transition to low-carbon economy) and physical risk (posed by acute weather events) for different asset classes (e.g., corporate bond, municipal bonds, real estate, and wholesale loans). The team is also developing machine-learning models to assess the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) and sustainability reports by clients in different industry sectors.

Climate risk analytics is an emerging field. Institutions around the world (e.g., regulators, banks, vendors, etc.) are grappling with the challenges in how to enhance the data, scenario design, and methodology. At this stage, GRA is currently developing a unified platform to onboard different “climate risk + machine learning” modules, and potentially utilizing open-source data (if deemed appropriate) for research purposes.

GRA is seeking an individual who is interested in applying data analytics and programming skills to empower our climate risk analytics capability. The intern student will be involved in researching open-source data platforms for climate risk, and developing Python-based tools for climate risk related analytics and machine learning applications. The candidate will learn data analytics and machine learning with applications in climate risk.









We thrive on the challenge to be our best, progressive thinking to keep growing, and working together to deliver trusted advice to help our clients thrive and communities prosper. We care about each other, reaching our potential, making a difference to our communities, and achieving success that is mutual.
