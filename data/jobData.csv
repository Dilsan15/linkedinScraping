You want to work with a team of developers that use machine learning to solve hard problems in real world, production environments. You understand ML techniques, but know that a cool model is nothing until you get it integrated into a great app used by actual users, with plans and tools to keep it up to date.

You’ll be joining the Super Auto team at Mappedin, which is a feature team comprised of Machine Learning, Front End, and Full Stack developers. They can take a new ML-powered tool from inception all the way to production, and keep it fresh once it’s deployed. As a Machine Learning Developer you will help bridge the gap between pure machine learning and feature deployment.

You are highly interested in learning about or already have experience in:


We understand that not everyone will be familiar with the tech stack or will check all of the boxes above. We would still love for you to apply and we will provide support if required!


You’ll need to know a bit about a bunch of different things. We don’t expect you to be an expert in coming up with the right ML technique to use for a given problem, but we do expect you to be able to pick up how to best help train, use, deploy, and maintain it. Most of Mappedin’s codebase is written in TypeScript, but the ML is done in Python, so you will end up using both languages, and the more you can push to TypeScript the more the rest of the Dev team can contribute.

Mappedin moves fast and we sometimes change directions. We can’t always wait for all the information before we try something. If you want us to guarantee exactly what you’ll be working on three months from now, we can’t give you that. On the other hand, there is a lot of high value work to do, and it won’t be boring.

Mappedin follows the Test Driven Development methodology to write code that is testable, tested, and only does what it needs to do. We don’t expect you to be an expert in TDD when you start, but we do expect you to become one. You also own the quality of your own work, and we expect you to prove that with your own integration and end to end tests.


We run an agile development process designed to give our developers as much uninterrupted development time as possible. Most days the only meeting you’re looking at is the morning standup.

We use a variety of technology and tools that currently include TypeScript, React, Jest, Three.js, Webpack, Node.js, Postgres, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.

There’s a lot of trust here at Mappedin. We are a REMOTE company. If you’re local, there will probably be a few days a week when you can expect other people to be in the office, but this role could also be fully remote. We work flexible hours, have a flexible vacation policy and work to provide the hardware or office equipment you require to unleash your potential. We will do what it takes to get things done if we said we would do it. We stay curious, challenge opinions, take risks, and learn from mistakes. We’re competitive and we like to win together. We want you to join us.

Mappedin welcomes applications from people with disabilities. We provide reasonable accommodations for candidates upon request through the recruitment process. For additional information, please email us at accessibility@mappedin.com or call us at (519) 594-0102 and ask to speak to a member of the Human Resources team.
